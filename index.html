                <h2> A Little About Me </h2>
                  <p> A Brief History (I promise!)<br>
                    My story starts all the way back in 2003 with my first coding class. I LOVED it. However, when the second level class didn't fit into my schedule, I convinced myself it wasn't meant to be and that changing majors would be too hard at that point.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward to 2010. I was working my engineering day job, and needed to learn Visual Basic and Macros to put together a life cycle calculator. I had a blast! Out of all of my years of engineering, it's one of the projects I am the most proud of. </p>
      			</div>
      			<div class="half-width">
                    <p>Take another jump in time to 2017. At this point I have earned my Masters of Engineering Management, my MBA, and added two kids to my family. I was unhappy with the work life balance available at my day job, and felt that I had a unique set of skills that would be helpful to a wide variety of moms trying to start their own businesses. </p>

                    <p>The Lightbulb Moment
                    I saw a Facebook ad for Skillcrush and immediately signed up for their 10 day bootcamp. I was so excited, I finished it in one day. Visions of freelancing to help working moms and SAHMs withe their businesses flooded my brain. Skill crush was just the inspiration, accountability, and bow on top to tie together the talent and experience I already had to provide kiss butt service to any small business.</p>
